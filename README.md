# FF Legend Edition (Unofficial)

Unofficial Foundry VTT system for [FF Legend Edition](https://mildra.itch.io/finalfantasy-le). **This project is not endorsed by or affiliated with the designers of the game. Please do not contact them for support.**

## Prototype Notice

This system is in a prototype state right now. Anything at all could change right now, and neither backward nor forward compatibility are guaranteed. I extremely don't recommend using this for actual play at the moment.

## Installation

For now, just download the repo as a .zip and unzip it into a folder named `ffle-sheet` in your Foundry systems folder. When it's somewhat stable I'll start doing releases.

## Special Thanks

CSS stolen from [Asacolips' Boilerplate System](https://github.com/asacolips-projects/boilerplate), without which I might never have learned how to Foundry. Kudos!

And shout out to [Taragnor](https://github.com/taragnor), for teaching me how to work Typescript XD
