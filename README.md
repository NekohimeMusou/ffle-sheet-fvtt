## This is a prototype!

I made this to feel out Foundry's new application framework and have a quick way to playtest things; usability for actual play isn't really a goal. If I do decide to work on a system for actual use, there's a good chance it'll be a rewrite of this, using some of the stuff I've learned, and not backward compatible.

You need to target one or more tokens for the attack roller to work; you can hover them with your mouse and press the T key (make sure the chat window isn't focused), or use the target tool.

## Installation

For now, just download the repo as a .zip and unzip it into a folder named `ffle-sheet` in your Foundry systems folder. If I feel like it's at a point where it's useful in a game I'll start doing releases.

If you want to poke around in the source code, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/NekohimeMusou/ffle-sheet-fvtt/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for instructions on installing the development dependencies.

## Special Thanks

CSS stolen from [Asacolips' Boilerplate System](https://github.com/asacolips-projects/boilerplate), without which I might never have learned how to Foundry. Thank you!
