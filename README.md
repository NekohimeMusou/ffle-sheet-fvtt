# FF Legend Edition (Unofficial)

Unofficial Foundry VTT system for [FF Legend Edition](https://mildra.itch.io/finalfantasy-le). **This project is not endorsed by or affiliated with the designers of the game. Please do not contact them for support.**

Please don't use our channels to be a jackass to people. For further information, see our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/NekohimeMusou/ffle-sheet-fvtt/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Prototype Notice

This system is in a prototype state right now. Anything at all could change right now, and neither backward nor forward compatibility are guaranteed. I extremely don't recommend using this for actual play at the moment. If I do make something meant to be used, it'll most likely be a new one that's more robustly designed from the start.

## Installation

For now, just download the repo as a .zip and unzip it into a folder named `ffle-sheet` in your Foundry systems folder. If I feel like it's at a point where it's useful in a game I'll start doing releases.

If you want to contribute, or just poke around in the source code, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/NekohimeMusou/ffle-sheet-fvtt/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for instructions on installing the development dependencies.

## Special Thanks

CSS stolen from [Asacolips' Boilerplate System](https://github.com/asacolips-projects/boilerplate), without which I might never have learned how to Foundry. Thank you!
